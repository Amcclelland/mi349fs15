Design Principles:

I decided to do Mapping; attatched are two simple html/css pages


Card Sort :

I already did a preliminary sort of my cards for last weeks assignment using the Optimal Sort website.

I have a screenshot of the webpage where I sorted my cards and will be including the image file from last week & a converted PDF view of the same image.
